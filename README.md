# Data Base Fianl Project
## About:
This project was our (me and https://github.com/mohsenyz) university DataBase project that we should make a **Payroll management system**.

## Techs:
I implement this site with **Next.js** and my styles were with **Scss Modules**
and I used **Axios** for data fetching

### HOC:
A good point of this project was usage of a **HOC**(**H**igh **O**rder **C**omponent) for authorizing users.

In fact at first, when page wants to render, accessibility checked and then related to user access, content will loading!

### UI/UX:
At First when we started to doing the project, I have my plan for designing the site in Figma to learning it trying to have a clean website
and then implement it in code but time lack made us to quit design and continue without that.
